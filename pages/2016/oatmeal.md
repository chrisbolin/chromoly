title: How To Prepare Oatmeal

The kitchen sink is an emotional and domestic bellwether: has yesterday been resolved? Can today begin unburdened? Or are there outstanding debts, pans caked with bits of a meal already forgotten?

This morning is unencumbered: the right basin (the shallower of the two) is empty; the left basin is filled with clean, orderly, dry dishes. (Our small apartment does not have a dishwasher.)

I remove a canister of oatmeal from the cupboard. Because it is cheap, convenient, and healthy, it is my de facto breakfast. The mediocre taste and texture quietly honor asceticism, a virtue I've long associated with wisdom (a nod to my father’s Protestantism?).

There are two general techniques to prepare oatmeal that I know of:

A. Heat approximately 1 cup of water to boiling, then combine gradually with a serving of oatmeal, using only as much water as is necessary to achieve the desired consistency.

or

B. Combine approximately 1 cup of tap water with a serving of oatmeal, using only as much water as is necessary to achieve the desired consistency (importantly accounting for any water lost to subsequent heating), then heat the mixture.

I firmly support A, as I cannot fathom why anyone would take B’s risk of incorrectly estimating the oatmeal-water ratio before heating, leading to either an inedible dry brick (not enough water) or hot oat soup (too much water). My wife subscribes to B and we do not discuss the topic often.

I place the water into the microwave, an appliance that has been omnipresent in my lifetime, rising to prominence in the United States just before I was born. It is a strange device, bombarding water with radiation, literally spinning the tiny molecules to a boil.

To pass the time I move some of the dry, clean dishes from the sink to the shelves above. Both the sink and the small gas stove next to it are bone white and older than my parents. Along with the creaking wooden floors and cast iron radiators they transform the apartment into a makeshift live-in time capsule: this is World War II New England.

Despite its dated fixtures (also there are no three-prong electrical outlets [Fun fact: grounded three-prong outlets were required in the 1971 National Electrical Code, effective January 1, 1974 - forty-two years ago tomorrow.]) and small size, this apartment is the most expensive I've rented. My rent has risen monotonically over my adulthood, sometimes in small inflationary steps, sometimes in large migratory leaps. If I now reversed those migrations, left the East Coast and returned to the Great Plains, my current rent check would surely secure a small mansion, full of shiny Frigidaire doors, silent floors, and approved electrical wiring.

After my breakfast is prepared, I walk down the short hallway (creak, creak) to the living room. On the coffee table, next to a bold red skein of yarn and a bold red crocheted scarf, is my wife’s wedding ring. I quickly note the simple connection - the ring must have been an impediment to her crocheting last night and had to be removed - but not before experiencing a slight preamble to panic, seeing this symbolic object in a symbolically threatening pose. I briefly but vividly imagine a bitter fight and a discarded ring before I fade back to reality.

I pick up the ring and inspect it. The small center diamond is flanked by two even smaller diamonds; all three are set in 14-karat white gold. I bought it when I was twenty-three years old, four months after graduating from college. Over the intervening years I have been both embarrassed of the diamonds’ small size (2011, Cambridge, Massachusetts: my best friend introduces us to his Harvard Business School classmates) and ashamed they were diamonds at all (2010, Austin, Texas: we watch Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond on DVD). Now I see that this tiny ring is a snapshot of another moment: that moment we were naïve and poor and got married too young by any reasonable measure. So often happiness is not reasonable.
