From the dirt path she saw the distant highway; it filled the forest with a muffled amorphous roar, an organic buzz. But its sound did not match its sight. No, the small cars sped alone - red, silver, black, blue - each a discrete mass; only together did their tiny voices melt into the deep, even chorus.

She clutched the small stick in her hand, feeling its rough bark and smooth core before throwing it again down the path. The dog left her side and sprinted after it, his four paws a staccato cadence, fading. Soon he would return and drop the twig at her feet, wagging his tail with Sisyphean joy: again, again, again.
